            <p class="subtitle">My first major AI-powered project: a personalized Python music player built to be simple, robust, and uniquely functional.</p>
            <div class="project-detail-note" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
                <strong>Note:</strong> This was a huge learning experience. The UI is basic and the entire 2100+ lines of code are in a single file! It's a testament to how far my development practices have come.

                <h2>The One-File Wonder</h2>
                <p>FNote v1 was my first dive into a large-scale application, I don't use it anymore though due to FNote v2 being objectively better. It's built entirely in <strong>Python</strong>, using the standard <code>tkinter</code> library for the GUI and <code>python-vlc</code> for its powerful audio playback capabilities. This choice, however, came with a catch: users must have VLC Media Player installed on their system for it to work.</p>
                <p>Reflecting my novice understanding of software architecture at the time, the entire application—every function, class, and UI element—is contained within a single Python file that's over 2100 lines long. It's a bit of a monolith, but it works!</p>

                <h3>Try It Yourself</h3>
                <p>You can download the full project from the GitHub repository. The release includes a pre-packaged executable with VLC already bundled, so you don't need to install anything extra.</p>

                <h2>Core Features</h2>
                <p>Despite its simple appearance, FNote v1 has a solid set of features that I wanted in a personal music player:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standard music player controls (play, pause, skip).</li>
                    <li>Song importing and playlist management.</li>
                    <li>Loop and Shuffle modes.</li>
                    <li>Ability to run on startup, so music plays as soon as the PC boots.</li>
                    <li>And its most unique feature...</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h3>The Killer Feature: Auto-Pause</h3>
                <p>The standout feature of FNote v1 is its ability to <strong>auto-pause when external audio is detected.</strong> If I'm listening to music and a YouTube video starts playing, FNote automatically pauses. When the video's audio stops, FNote seamlessly resumes the music. This feature alone took a solid two weeks of the one-month development cycle.</p>
                <p>It was a complex problem that required a multi-AI approach. I struggled with several models until <strong>Deepseek-R1</strong> managed to create a working prototype script. I then took that proof-of-concept to <strong>Gemini</strong>, which successfully integrated the functionality into the main tkinter application.</p>
