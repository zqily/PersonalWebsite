            <h1>FNote v2</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">My magnum opus (for now). A ground-up rewrite of my music player, featuring a modern UI and a feature set that rivals commercial apps, all built with a next-gen AI.</p>

                <strong>Status: Archived.</strong> Production is complete, but the project is held back by the limitations of then-current AI and my own ambition. Built entirely with vanilla JS, it's a feature-rich but flawed piece I've learned a ton from.

                <h2>From Monolith to Masterpiece</h2>
                <p>With the... unimpressive results and horrible underlying architecture of <a href="../fnote1/fnote1.html">FNote v1</a> (all 2100+ lines in one file), I chose to abandon the project and start from scratch. FNote v1 was built with an older AI, and I knew the newer models were capable of so much more. This time, I also made a crucial architectural decision: use an <strong>HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a Python backend</strong>.</p>
                <p>To this day, AIs still suck at creating complex UIs with Python libraries like `tkinter` or `PyQt`. But they are masters of web technologies—this very website is proof. By leveraging this strength, I knew I could create something special. The very first prototype Gemini produced had a solid layout, and from there, I continued to build. The result is a testament to the power of this approach, though my ambition to write everything in vanilla JS without a framework like React ultimately introduced a host of bugs. I call it my "Notion-inspired" lesson in humility.</p>

                <h2>Ambition and Its Pitfalls</h2>
                <p>Despite my best efforts to optimize, the project became a victim of its own complexity. By choosing to write everything in vanilla JavaScript, I essentially had to reinvent the wheel for features that frameworks like React or Svelte provide for free. This led to a brittle codebase where about 90% of my intended features were implemented, but a frustrating 40% of those were plagued with bugs. It's a classic case of biting off more than you can chew, and a valuable lesson in choosing the right tools for the job.</p>

                <h2>A Symphony of Features</h2>
                <p>FNote v2 includes every feature from its predecessor and introduces a host of powerful new ones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Modern UI:</strong> All the basic music player features (play/pause, seek, shuffle, loop) wrapped in a clean interface with slick animations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Miniplayer Mode:</strong> A sleek, compact miniplayer that expands on hover, providing full functionality without taking up screen space.</li>
                    <li><strong>Song Markers:</strong> Per-song markers allow you to highlight and jump to the best part of any track.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive Tagging:</strong> A powerful tagging system lets you create custom tags and apply them to individual or multiple songs for easy filtering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Playlists & Queues:</strong> Full playlist and queue management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Import/Export:</strong> Share and back up your playlists with the custom <code>.fnlist</code> file type—a glorified zip file containing all song data, covers, and a JSON manifest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Windows Integration:</strong> An optional setting registers the <code>.fnlist</code> file type, allowing you to import playlists simply by double-clicking them.</li>
                    <li><strong>YT-DLP Integration:</strong> Download songs or entire playlists from the web directly into the app.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Prized Feature:</strong> My favorite feature from v1, perfected. The app auto-pauses when it detects external audio and resumes when it's gone. You can even manage an ignore list for apps like Lively Wallpaper or FxSound.</li>
                </ul>
