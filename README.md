# My Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's a static site built with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript to showcase my projects and skills.

## About This Project

This website serves as a central hub for my work. It features a clean, modern design with a focus on readability and showcasing projects in detail. One of the key projects featured is **FNote v2**, a conceptual application for which the styling is included in this repository (`fnote2.css`).

The primary purpose of this repository is to host the site on GitHub Pages and serve as a code archive.

## Tech Stack

This website was built using fundamental web technologies:

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (with CSS Variables for theming)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript**

No frameworks or complex build tools were used, keeping it lightweight and fast.

## Project Status
